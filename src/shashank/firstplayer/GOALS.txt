Goals I want to accomplish
	1) Gardening, and setting economy
	2) Creating Dodging and attcking code
	
Ideas for movement:
	Use repulse mechanism
		Use channels 1-5000 for markers, marking locations that robots should avoid
		Creates a "path" for robots to follow
		If robot is stuck, has no where to go, mark its position as a "repulse marker", creating space as robots behind it can move away
		
		
Pathfinding:
	A* algo is mainly used for path finding.
