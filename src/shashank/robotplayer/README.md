Battlecode Project Version Notes
================================

Here you'll find everything you need to know about the different versions.

# Versions

## 1.0.0

### 1.0

- Archons, Gardeners, Soldiers, and Lumberjacks were heavily modified
- Archons maintains a squad of 8 gardeners and only spawns new ones when it
one is about to die
- Gardeners search for an empty spot, while building lumberjacks and
soldiers
- Gardeners maintain a squad of 20 soldiers and 30 lumberjacks

#### Notes

- Gardeners are not moving at all, need fixing
- Idea: use scout to broadcast enemy locations, since scouts have double
the sense radius of all other robots, as well as twice the stride radius
- Gardeners are not releasing robots fast enough
